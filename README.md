The importance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been frequently discussed before when we talked about image classification, speech recognition, and other issues in AI. Neural networks are well-suited to help humans solve problems and challenges in real-life scenarios by improving decision-making processes in different areas. Cinematography is one of them.

In movie recommendation systems, ANNs are particularly helpful and can be used as autoencoders in many sectors. The neural networks use the training data to predict movie recommendations with high accuracy for the target users. Therefore, the most important part is to get the right movie datasets to create a neural network model for movie recommendation systems. Equally important is to make the right manipulations with this data.

A neural network model, in this case, consists of three layers:

Input. The first layer of a neural network model, where the movie and user vectors are selected as input.
Embedding. The second layer contains embeddings for both movies and users. They are updated during the model training to get the best values of these embeddings and lower the error rate between actual and predicted values.
Output. The final third level generates the predicted values and can consist of one or more neurons provided by the user to the movie.
Once a neural network model is created for the movie recommendation system, itâ€™s time to train the model on the training movie dataset and make predictions.
